# DiscTSBot
This is an opensource project where we develop a bot that connects from discord to a Teamspeak server.
This bot will make it easy to find your friends if they are not connected to your discord server, 
but to one of the many teamspeak servers your friends are using.

## Setup (if you want to host the bot yourself)
1. Create a file called auth.json containing the token and login for your both.
```
{
    "token": "NjAyMjMyMjUwNzIwOTc2OTA2.XTOBbQ.teKEaq5ouZv15KMK9h8wl_Dxex4",
    "login": "602232250720976906"
}
```
